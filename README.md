## Context

First time I came across a problem like this was while I was completing the CS50's second week.

This exercise is important to me, because it was the first challenging code I wrote, among many helloworld.c files. You are expected to print a pyramid of blocks,
like those Mario has to jump over in World 1-1 in Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Brothers.

I spent many sleepless nights reading for loops documentation and examples, trying to figure out what to do... I don't think I will ever forget this exercise, 
and today I wanted to test my luck again and see if I could improve the solution. I think I did, and it was a good excuse to create seasonal code emulating a pine.

## Usability

This program will prompt user for a height size (recommended values are between 1-10 for better visualization) and will return a centered pyramid in text, 
using hashes (#) for bricks.
